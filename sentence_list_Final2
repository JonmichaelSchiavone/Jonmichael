Adelphi University�s roots reach back to 1863 and the founding of the Adelphi Academy, a private preparatory school in Brooklyn, New York. The Academy was incorporated in 1869 and its Board of Trustees was charged with establishing a first class institution for the broadest and most thorough training, and to make its advantages as accessible as possible to the largest numbers of our population. The school quickly gained a reputation for its innovative curriculum, particularly in physical culture and early childhood education. The appointment of Charles H. Levermore, PhD, as the head of the Academy in 1893 was an important moment in Adelphi�s history. Realizing the city of Brooklyn was without a liberal arts college, Levermore seized the opportunity to establish Adelphi College. Through the efforts of Timothy Woodruff, former lieutenant governor of New York State and future president of Adelphi�s Board of Trustees, Adelphi College, with 57 students and 16 instructors, was granted a charter�one of the earliest charters granted to a coeducational college by the Board of Regents of the State of New York�on June 24, 1896. Henceforth, degrees issued bore the seals of Adelphi College and of the University of the State of New York and were signed by the officers of the College and by the chancellor and the secretary of the University. For the next 25 years, the Academy remained intact yet separate from the College. Over the course of the next 100 years Adelphi grew and changed significantly. In 1929, Adelphi University became the first private, coeducational institution of higher education on Long Island. Since that time, more than 100,000 students have passed through our doors, leaving their mark on the University and the world beyond. Today, Adelphi is thriving. Our colleges and schools include the College of Arts and Sciences; the Gordon F. Derner School of Psychology; the Honors College; the Robert B. Willumstad School of Business; the College of Education and Health Sciences (comprised of the Ruth S. Ammon School of Education and the School of Health Sciences); the College of Nursing and Public Health; the School of Social Work; and the College of Professional and Continuing Studies. We have reinvigorated our academic community and invested in our future. Our faculty is leading the way to ensure that our students receive the finest education in the region and that Adelphi continues to serve as a vital resource to our local communities. As we turn our strategic plan into a vision for our future, the campus community has come together to accomplish mutual goals centered on scholarship and student achievement. While universities around the country have been eliminating faculty, Adelphi has hired more than 280 new professors since 2001. Current full- and part-time faculty total 956, with a student/faculty ratio of 10:1. To ensure that our scholars have the resources needed to reach their goals, we have invested millions of dollars in infrastructure. We have renovated our facilities; upgraded our technology and created smart classrooms; dramatically improved our libraries�both facilities and collections; and invested in new equipment, including state-of-the-art lasers for two new physics laboratories, an atomic scanning microscope and a nuclear magnetic resonance machine for the chemistry program, new pianos from Steinway & Sons, and enhanced digital music facilities to support our music and performing arts programs. An ambitious campus expansion project has, over the last decade, resulted in the completion and opening of the Adele and Herbert J. Klapper Center for Fine Arts with space for painting, printmaking, sculpture and ceramics; the Center for Recreation and Sports, containing gyms and an indoor track; the Performing Arts Center (AUPAC) includes a 500-seat Concert Hall and additional performance, rehearsal and classroom space for music, theatre and dance; an outdoor sports complex; a complete renovation of Woodruff Hall with a modern exercise room, pool, teaching gym and classroom; the Alice Brown Early Learning Center; and additional parking. Scholars throughout the University are making significant contributions to their disciplines. In recent years, Adelphi faculty members have been recognized as Fulbright and Hartford Scholars, and have received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. The School of Social Work is accredited for the maximum time that the accrediting agency grants. In fact, our School of Social Work was reaccredited with no recommendations for improvement by the Council on Social Work Education�s site evaluation committee, and the School�s self-study document so impressed the council that it is now used as a model in reaccreditation training sessions for other programs. Currently, more than 8,100 students are thriving in our classrooms, in our programs, on our sports fields at the main Garden City campus and at centers in Manhattan, Hauppauge, and Poughkeepsie. Our students have gone on to achieve awards and national recognition for their scholarship, service and leadership. Adelphi also seeks to serve its locality, state and nation through the research and practice of its faculty; the strengthening of ties between the professional schools and community; the staging of distinguished cultural events at its campuses; and most essentially, the education of a generation of future leaders and informed citizens, professionals, and community members. The Adelphi Panthers are the athletic teams that represent Adelphi University, located in Garden City, Long Island, New York, in NCAA Division II intercollegiate sports. The university fields 23 varsity sports programs, and the Panthers compete as members of the Northeast-10 Conference in 22 of their 23 sports. The women's bowling team competes within the East Coast Conference as an affiliate. Adelphi has been a member of the NE10 since 2009, after joining from the ECC. Opened in 2008, the 76,000-square-foot Center for Recreation and Sports (CRS) features a three-court gymnasium, a suspended running track and significantly upgraded athletic training and rehabilitation rooms. Complementing CRS is Adelphi�s fully renovated Woodruff Hall, which houses a fitness center, pool and additional playing courts. Adelphi also has invested in its fields and outdoor competition spaces, including its all-weather Motamed Field, Janet L. Ficke Field for softball and William J. Bonomo Memorial Field for baseball. NCAA National Championships [ edit ]

The Panthers have won 17 NCAA Division II National Championships in three different sports, with 16 of 17 coming in the sport of lacrosse. The men's lacrosse team has won seven national crowns with the last coming in 2001. The women's lacrosse team has won nine, including three consecutive National Championships in 2009, 2010, 2011, consecutive championships in 2014 and 2015, and another national crown in 2017 and 2019. In 1974, the men's soccer team were the national champions, and the Adelphi track and field program has also won numerous individual national championships. Since transitioning to the Northeast-10, the Adelphi Panthers have become a powerhouse in the East Region. In 2013, just their fourth year in the conference, the Panthers were awarded the 2013 Northeast-10 Presidents' Cup. The Presidents' Cup is presented annually to signify overall athletic excellence in the Northeast-10. The honor is awarded to the institution that compiles the most total points from all of its programs competing in league championships. [2] Since arriving in the Northeast-10 in 2009, the Panthers have collected 27 regular season conference titles, 29 tournament championships, 41 individual crowns and captured the Northeast-10 Presidents' Cup four times (2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017), while winning six NCAA Division II National Championships.

The baseball team has participated in the NCAA Tournament 16 times in its history, and has advanced to the Division II College World Series four times. The team has seen several of their players selected in the MLB first year player draft, including Bobby Lanigan who was selected in the 3rd round (92nd overall) by the Minnesota Twins in 2008 and Keith Couch who was selected 413th overall by the Boston Red Sox in 2010. In 2013, the Panthers' single-season and career saves leader Dillion McNamara was selected in the 27th round by the New York Yankees. The baseball team is currently led by former Yankees bullpen coach Dom Scala, who was named head coach in 2004. Their home games are played at William J. Bonomo Memorial Field, a state of the art artificial turf complex located in the heart of the campus. Soccer [ edit ]

Adelphi fields both a men's and women's soccer team. Adelphi's men's soccer team competed at the NCAA Division I level until 2012, following the dissolution of the Atlantic Soccer Conference in 2011; starting in 2013, men's soccer will compete at the Division II level. [8]

The men's team won the 1974 Division II National Championship, and have won three ASC championships: in 2006, 2008, and 2009. In addition, they were also declared tournament champions in 2006 and 2009. The team produced former professional soccer player and United States national team member Chris Armas, who was a USISL All-Star for the Long Island Rough Riders and in 1996 was selected in the first round of the MLS Supplemental Draft by the Los Angeles Galaxy. He also went on to play for Puerto Rican and United States national teams. Armas returned to Garden City in 2011 to take the reins of the women's soccer team as head coach. The women's soccer team has won 7 ECC championships (1996, 1997, 2001�04, 2007). [9] In 2012, the Panthers advanced to the Northeast-10 Conference Championship game as the No. 8 seed, the first No. 8 seed in the history of the conference championships to do so. [10]

Volleyball [ edit ]

Under the direction of head coach Danielle MacKnight, the volleyball team has become one of the leading programs in the NCAA Division II East Region. In 2009, MacKnight received the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) Thirty Under 30 Award as one of the top thirty coaches under the age of 30 in the nation at all levels. Under her direction, the Panthers have recorded six consecutive season of 20 wins or more and have appeared in six consecutive NCAA Tournaments. Over that span, the Panthers have had 13 All-Region selections, one ESPN: The Magazine All-American and, in 2013, one AVCA Division II All-American, the first in the 20-year history of the program. In 2011, the Panthers took home the program's first-ever conference championship after winning the Northeast-10 Tournament title, and claimed back-to-back conference crowns in 2014 and 2015. Women's basketball [ edit ]

After a series of lean years following strong results in the early 2000s, the women's basketball team claimed the program's first NE-10 Tournament crown in 2014 after hosting three playoff games and defeating American International College in the championship. Behind a 28-3 record, the Panthers were awarded the top seed and hosting privileges in the 2015 Division II East Regional. Softball [ edit ]

Adelphi's softball team appeared in three Women's College World Series in 1984, 1985 and 1988 as a Division I program. [11] In 2015, the Panthers advanced to their first WCWS as a Division II program, and repeated the feat in the 2016 season. Adelphi�s Innovation Center (IC), located on the first floor of Swirbul Library, launched in February 2020. Its mission is simple: to develop opportunities for applied learning by connecting faculty and students with external business partners to prepare students for today�s competitive job market. �Employers are looking for recent graduates who have hands-on experience solving real-world problems,� said Graziela Fusaro, assistant provost for innovation. �Here at the Innovation Center, we prepare students to develop their careers in whatever majors they choose. We help them develop problem-solving skills, think on their feet, find a solution, think out of the frames of the classroom and complete their education with this deep experiential learning component��all valuable skills in today�s workplace. Since the IC launched, 642 students benefited from experiential learning projects designed in partnership with 63 organizations. Fusaro explained that the IC has designed programs for undergraduate and graduate students to work on both curricular and extracurricular initiatives. Regardless of their major, interested students can either register on the website for curricular experiences for credit or extracurricular certificates or they can participate in classes that are in partnership with the IC. Duc Le, an international student from Vietnam, expects to graduate in December with a Master of Science in Supply Chain Management. He�ll take with him the valuable work experience he gained from two different internships. With the help of the Innovation Center, he created strategic plans for Generational Mental Health and DeliverThat, respectively. He said the internships have been a meaningful experience for him: �It�s not easy to get working experience as an international student, so I�m very thankful for the opportunities provided by the Innovation Center,� he said, adding that he thinks other students should take advantage of what the IC offers. �These projects you do outside of school are what make you stand out in your career search.�

During the shutdown, that meant joining forces with the Center for Career and Professional Development to help shift the Jaggar Community Fellows Program to a virtual format. As a result, 100 students were placed in virtual internships with 12 companies last year. The Innovation Center Inside the Classroom

Virtual Team Internship Program: Over 11 weeks, students immerse themselves in projects pertaining to their major/program of study and collaborate with students around the world to work with companies and nonprofits; they also receive credits and full mentorship from the Innovation Center

LIVE Classes: Students work with companies and organizations the IC partners with on specific projects under the guidance of their professors. The companies Zoom into the classes, allowing participation with both local and international firms and NPOs (nonprofit organization) such as Safe Place International in Greece and programs in Ecuador and Honduras. The students create innovative proposals and present solutions for client needs while developing their professional skills and building their r�sum�s. Approximately 161 students in seven different classes have participated in LIVE classes since last fall. Cristina Zaccarini, PhD, associate professor of history, has been teaching IC LIVE classes since it was launched. �All of these skills that students are learning through this work with the Innovation Center will have an immediate resonance with an employer,� she said. �I think the IC will make Adelphi students really stand out to future employers because they�ll have experiences that they would not have otherwise had. I encourage professors and students to participate. There�s something that can be gained for everyone through the Innovation Center program.�

The Innovation Center Outside the Classroom

The IC also develops programs that are offered as extracurriculars and are open to all students. Business Plan Competition: The Innovation Center partners with the Robert B. Willumstad School of Business on an annual Shark Tank�style business plan competition. Students gain hands-on experience in problem-solving, strategic thinking and presentation skills as they vie for cash prizes. Innovation Center Labs: These long-term partnerships allow students, faculty and companies to combine resources to address specific challenges. Under a new partnership with Thorlabs, students and faculty will have opportunities to do research in optics in the physics lab. Another example is the partnership with Fragrance.Net, with the goal of building a machine learning model to predict optimal pricing for certain products. Digital Badges: In partnership with IBM Skills Academy, the Innovation Center offers training and certification programs that will help students gain applied knowledge to better position them in the job market. The Innovation Center is offering digital badges in the following areas: data science, artificial intelligence, design thinking and others. Zeynep Atabay, IBM accredited instructor and former IC operations manager, said that data science and design thinking are critical parts of any career today. �I�ve been trained over 100 hours by IBM�s instructional designers as an accredited instructor to teach faculty and students in areas like data science, design thinking and artificial intelligence,� she said. �Our goal at the IC is to bring this knowledge back to our faculty to equip them with new resources and, of course, design new experiences for our students.�

In addition to credits or certification from Adelphi, students get a digital badge from IBM that gets attached to their LinkedIn profile. �One of the missions of the Innovation Center,� Fusaro said, �is to provide deep, valuable, experiential learning opportunities to work on a problem with a company or NPO and have students and faculty find a solution together.� Experience Adelphi�s personalized approach to education and enroll in our Summer Pre-College programs, which include residential credit-bearing experiences on our Garden City campus and non-credit certificate opportunities on our Manhattan campus. College Consensus recently ranked Adelphi�s Pre-College Summer programs among the top 30 in the US, and here�s why:

You can live on our beautiful flagship Garden City campus and take a class in the kind of exciting, challenging subject you dream about�or choose a non-credit day program that immerses you in Manhattan life. You will work with our professors and instructors, and meet with experts in the field. You will go on exciting off-campus trips, including to nearby New York City. If you choose a credit-bearing program, you will walk away with three transferable college credits. It�s a great introduction to the hands-on, high-impact learning at Adelphi � and an unforgettable growing experience. Adelphi University�s Diversity Committee is a campus-wide committee reporting to the Provost. Formed in 1998, the committee has been charged with providing leadership and advancing the University�s diversity goals. Committee membership includes representation from faculty, staff, administrators and students from all areas of the campus community. The committee underscores the importance of advancing diversity within institutions of higher education to reflect the changing demographics of the population and the growing globalization of society. The committee�s definition of diversity includes race, creed, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, genetic predisposition or carrier status, religion, marital status, veteran status, or any other basis protected by applicable local, state, or federal laws. What We Do

How the committee is working to advance diversity

In support of the strategic plan, to include monitoring and enhancing the curriculum, diversity climate, and recruitment and retention throughout the campus, the committee makes recommendations to the President and Board of Trustees via the Office of the Provost. The committee works with academic units and other administrative offices to coordinate and promote activities in furthering its goals, including:

Engaging students, faculty, and staff in meaningful dialogue on the topics of diversity and inclusion

Engaging students, faculty and staff in the process of inclusion

Reviewing existing policies on recruitment and retention of students, faculty, and staff of color

Evaluating opportunities to improve the campus climate through curricular initiatives and institutional change including bridging the gap between Student Affairs and academic units

Providing technical assistance in developing a comprehensive diversity plan

Serving as a resource to infuse diversity throughout the curriculum

Evaluating the mission of the Diversity Committee. Committee representatives share information and work with their constituencies to address issues, build bridges, and solve problems. The committee also assists in addressing problems that are brought to its attention by individuals or groups. In order to cultivate a climate that values and supports the University�s Core Values related to diversity, any student, faculty or staff member may contact a representative of the committee to find information and resources, get assistance with promoting initiatives related to diversity, and get direction on how to resolve a concern. In some cases, the committee will deliberate what action(s) to take and refer the matter to the appropriate office, department, or individual, based on existing University policy. Current Initiatives

The Diversity Committee is responsible for proposing initiatives to address diversity-related issues affecting our campus community. Adelphi University�s tuition is $42,475. Compared with the national average cost of tuition of $41,281, Adelphi University is more expensive. These figures include both tuition and fees, also referred to as the sticker price. Fees differ by institution and may fund library services, student gym facilities, student centers, technology resources and campus health centers.
